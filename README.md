# information-representation-swift-playground-book
A swift playground book for students to explore the ways information is stored in a computer.

 Many computer science curricula would benefit from including a section that portrays a computer as just a machine that processes information.  
 
 A student's understanding of the the computer as a machine and the basic functions of that machine serves two purposes: 1) it removes the mystic about computers and programming, and provides a level of confidence about the device, 2) it provides an added level of expertise facilitating design decisions later in the student's programming career.  A student who understands how the machine and the memory works is more likely to make design decisions that most optimally use the machine and its resources, and more likely to store and retrieve information on the computer in efficient and resourceful ways.
